> **"A rigid body can both translate and rotate—and often does both simultaneously."**

## Prerequisites

`curvilinear_motion` `newtons_second_law`

## Learning Objectives

1. **Describe** rigid body types of motion
2. **Relate** angular and linear quantities
3. **Apply** velocity/acceleration equations for rotation
4. **Analyze** relative motion on a rigid body

## Types of Rigid Body Motion

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Translation** | All points move with same velocity |
| **Rotation about fixed axis** | All points circle around the axis |
| **General plane motion** | Translation + rotation combined |

## Angular Kinematics (Fixed Axis)

$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}, \quad \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}
$$

For constant $\alpha$:
$$
\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t
$$
$$
\theta = \theta_0 + \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2
$$

---

## Relating Linear and Angular

For a point at distance $r$ from axis:

$$
\boxed{v = r\omega, \quad a_t = r\alpha, \quad a_n = r\omega^2}
$$

---

## Relative Motion on Rigid Body

$$
\vec{v}_B = \vec{v}_A + \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}_{B/A}
$$

where $\vec{r}_{B/A}$ is the position of B relative to A.

## Summary

- Rigid bodies can translate, rotate, or do both
- $v = r\omega$, $a_t = r\alpha$, $a_n = r\omega^2$
- For general motion: $v_B = v_A + \omega \times r_{B/A}$

## What's Next?

In **Section 3.2: Equations of Motion**, we'll apply Newton's laws to rotating rigid bodies.
