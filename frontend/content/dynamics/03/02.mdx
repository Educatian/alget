## Prerequisites

`newtons_second_law` `rigid_body_motion`

## Learning Objectives

1. **Apply** $\sum F = ma_G$ for center of mass
2. **Apply** $\sum M_G = I_G \alpha$ for rotation
3. **Solve** planar rigid body dynamics problems
4. **Use** mass moment of inertia

## The Equations of Motion

For a rigid body in plane motion:

$$
\boxed{\sum F_x = m(a_G)_x}
$$

$$
\boxed{\sum F_y = m(a_G)_y}
$$

$$
\boxed{\sum M_G = I_G \alpha}
$$

where:
- $G$ = center of mass
- $I_G$ = mass moment of inertia about G
- $\alpha$ = angular acceleration

## Mass Moment of Inertia

| Shape | $I_G$ |
|-------|-------|
| Slender rod (about center) | $\frac{1}{12}mL^2$ |
| Thin disk/cylinder | $\frac{1}{2}mr^2$ |
| Solid sphere | $\frac{2}{5}mr^2$ |

**Parallel Axis Theorem:**
$$
I = I_G + md^2
$$

## Worked Example

**Problem:** A 10 kg disk (r = 0.3 m) has a tangential force of 20 N at its rim. Find angular acceleration.

**Solution:**

$$
I_G = \frac{1}{2}mr^2 = \frac{1}{2}(10)(0.3)^2 = 0.45 \text{ kg·m}^2
$$

$$
\sum M_G = F \cdot r = 20 \times 0.3 = 6 \text{ N·m}
$$

$$
\alpha = \frac{\sum M_G}{I_G} = \frac{6}{0.45} = \boxed{13.3 \text{ rad/s}^2}
$$

## Summary

- Translation: $\sum F = ma_G$
- Rotation: $\sum M_G = I_G \alpha$
- Use parallel axis theorem when rotating about non-CG point

## What's Next?

In **Section 3.3: Work-Energy for Rigid Bodies**, we'll extend energy methods to rotating systems.
