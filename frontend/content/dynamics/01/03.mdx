## The Fundamental Equation

The velocity of particle B as observed from (relative to) particle A:

$$
\boxed{\vec{v}_{B/A} = \vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A}
$$

Reading: "velocity of B relative to A"

Equivalently:
$$
\vec{v}_B = \vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_{B/A}
$$

> 💡 **Interpretation**: To find what velocity B appears to have when you're riding on A, subtract A's velocity from B's velocity.

## Sign Convention in 1D

For motion along a line, choose a positive direction:

| Scenario | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| Both moving right | $v_{B/A} = v_B - v_A$ |
| A right, B left | Use signs: $v_B < 0$ if leftward |
| Approaching | $v_{B/A}$ has opposite sign to $v_A$ |
| Separating | $v_{B/A}$ has same sign as $v_A$ |

---

## 2D Relative Motion

For vectors in 2D:

$$
\vec{v}_{B/A} = (v_{Bx} - v_{Ax})\hat{i} + (v_{By} - v_{Ay})\hat{j}
$$

Magnitude:
$$
|\vec{v}_{B/A}| = \sqrt{(v_{Bx} - v_{Ax})^2 + (v_{By} - v_{Ay})^2}
$$

## Common Applications

| Problem Type | Key Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Two cars on highway | 1D subtraction |
| Airplane in wind | Vector addition |
| River crossing | Decompose into components |
| Approaching collision | Find when $\vec{r}_{B/A} = 0$ |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1.4: Cars on Highway

**Problem:** Car A travels east at 25 m/s. Car B travels west at 20 m/s. Find the velocity of B relative to A.

**Solution:**

Let east = positive.
- $v_A = +25$ m/s
- $v_B = -20$ m/s (west is negative)

$$
v_{B/A} = v_B - v_A = -20 - 25 = \boxed{-45 \text{ m/s}}
$$

To observer in A, B appears to approach at 45 m/s from the east.

### Example 1.5: Airplane in Wind

**Problem:** A plane has airspeed 200 m/s north. Wind blows 50 m/s east. Find the ground velocity.

**Solution:**

$$
\vec{v}_{plane/ground} = \vec{v}_{plane/air} + \vec{v}_{air/ground}
$$

$$
\vec{v} = 200\hat{j} + 50\hat{i}
$$

Magnitude:
$$
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{200^2 + 50^2} = \sqrt{42500} = \boxed{206.2 \text{ m/s}}
$$

Direction: $\theta = \tan^{-1}(50/200) = 14.0°$ east of north.

## Summary

### Key Equations

| Concept | Equation |
|---------|----------|
| Relative velocity | $\vec{v}_{B/A} = \vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A$ |
| Absolute from relative | $\vec{v}_B = \vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_{B/A}$ |

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ "Velocity of B relative to A" = $\vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A$
- ✅ Choose a consistent **reference frame**
- ✅ In 2D, use **vector subtraction** component-wise
- ✅ Relative motion simplifies many "collision" problems
