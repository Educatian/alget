## Notation & Sign Convention

| Symbol | Meaning | Units | SI |
|--------|---------|-------|-----|
| $s$ or $x$ | Position | m | ✓ |
| $v$ | Velocity | m/s | ✓ |
| $a$ | Acceleration | m/s² | ✓ |
| $t$ | Time | s | ✓ |

> 📐 **Sign Convention**: Choose a positive direction (usually right or up). Displacements/velocities/accelerations in that direction are positive; opposite are negative.

## The Fundamental Relationships

### Velocity: Rate of Change of Position

$$
\boxed{v = \frac{ds}{dt}}
$$

Conversely:
$$
s = \int v \, dt
$$

### Acceleration: Rate of Change of Velocity

$$
\boxed{a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2s}{dt^2}}
$$

Conversely:
$$
v = \int a \, dt
$$

### The Chain Rule Relationship

When acceleration depends on position (not time):

$$
\boxed{a = v \frac{dv}{ds}}
$$

This leads to:
$$
v \, dv = a \, ds
$$

## Constant Acceleration Equations

When $a = \text{constant}$, we get the **kinematic equations**:

| Equation | Variables | Missing |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| $v = v_0 + at$ | $v, v_0, a, t$ | $s$ |
| $s = s_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ | $s, s_0, v_0, a, t$ | $v$ |
| $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(s - s_0)$ | $v, v_0, a, s$ | $t$ |
| $s = s_0 + \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v)t$ | $s, s_0, v_0, v, t$ | $a$ |

> 💡 **Strategy**: Identify what you know and what you need. Choose the equation that connects them without requiring the unknown you don't care about.

## Problem-Solving Procedure

### Step 1: Define Positive Direction
Choose which direction is positive (typically right or up).

### Step 2: Identify Knowns and Unknowns
List $s_0, s, v_0, v, a, t$—which are given? Which is asked?

### Step 3: Select Appropriate Equation
Pick the kinematic equation that contains your knowns and the target unknown.

### Step 4: Solve and Check Units
Ensure your answer has correct units and reasonable magnitude.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1.1: Car Braking (Constant Deceleration)

**Problem:** A car traveling at 25 m/s brakes with constant deceleration of 5 m/s². How far does it travel before stopping?

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Define positive direction*
Positive = direction of travel (forward)

*Step 2: Identify knowns*
- $v_0 = 25$ m/s
- $v = 0$ (stopped)
- $a = -5$ m/s² (negative because it opposes motion)
- Find: $s - s_0 = ?$

*Step 3: Choose equation*
Use $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(s - s_0)$ (no time needed)

*Step 4: Solve*
$$
0 = (25)^2 + 2(-5)(s - s_0)
$$
$$
0 = 625 - 10(s - s_0)
$$
$$
s - s_0 = \frac{625}{10} = \boxed{62.5 \text{ m}}
$$

### Example 1.2: Free Fall

**Problem:** A ball is dropped from rest at height 45 m. How long does it take to hit the ground?

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Define positive direction*
Positive = downward (direction of motion)

*Step 2: Identify knowns*
- $s_0 = 0$ (start at top)
- $s = 45$ m
- $v_0 = 0$ (dropped from rest)
- $a = g = 9.81$ m/s² (positive, downward)
- Find: $t = ?$

*Step 3: Choose equation*
Use $s = s_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

*Step 4: Solve*
$$
45 = 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2}(9.81)t^2
$$
$$
t^2 = \frac{45 \times 2}{9.81} = 9.17
$$
$$
t = \boxed{3.03 \text{ s}}
$$

## Common Pitfall

> ❌ **Mistake**: Forgetting that acceleration has a sign.
>
> ✅ **Correct**: If the object slows down while moving in the positive direction, acceleration is **negative**.

> ❌ **Mistake**: Using constant acceleration equations when acceleration varies.
>
> ✅ **Correct**: These equations apply ONLY when $a = \text{constant}$.

## Unit Check

| Equation | Unit Check |
|----------|------------|
| $v = v_0 + at$ | m/s = m/s + (m/s²)(s) = m/s ✓ |
| $s = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ | m = (m/s)(s) + (m/s²)(s²) = m ✓ |
| $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as$ | (m/s)² = (m/s)² + (m/s²)(m) ✓ |

---

## Sanity Check

- Doubling initial velocity → 4× stopping distance ✓
- Free fall: ~5 m in 1 s, ~20 m in 2 s, ~45 m in 3 s ✓
- Deceleration should reduce speed over time ✓

---

## Mini Check

> **Quick Question**: A particle starts from rest and accelerates at 2 m/s² for 5 s. What is its final velocity?
>
> **Answer**: $v = v_0 + at = 0 + (2)(5) = 10$ m/s

## Summary

### Key Equations

| Relationship | Equation |
|--------------|----------|
| Definition of velocity | $v = ds/dt$ |
| Definition of acceleration | $a = dv/dt$ |
| Constant acceleration | $v = v_0 + at$ |
| Constant acceleration | $s = s_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ |

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Velocity is the **derivative** of position; acceleration is the derivative of velocity
- ✅ Choose a **consistent sign convention** and stick to it
- ✅ Constant acceleration equations are your primary tools for 1D motion
- ✅ Always **check units** and do a **sanity check**
