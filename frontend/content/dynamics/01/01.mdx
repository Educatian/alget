# Introduction to Dynamics

Dynamics is the branch of classical mechanics that deals with the study of forces and their effects on motion. 
Unlike statics, which examines systems in equilibrium, dynamics focuses on objects that are accelerating.

## Key Concepts
- **Kinematics:** The geometry of motion (position, velocity, acceleration) without considering forces.
- **Kinetics:** The relationship between the forces acting on a body and its resulting motion.

In this course, we will heavily focus on Rigid Body Mechanics and investigate how forces generate torque and translation.
