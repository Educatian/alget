## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Describe** motion using normal-tangential (n-t) coordinates
2. **Apply** polar (r-θ) coordinates for circular motion
3. **Calculate** tangential and normal acceleration components
4. **Analyze** circular motion problems

## Notation & Sign Convention

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| $\hat{e}_t$ | Unit tangent vector | — |
| $\hat{e}_n$ | Unit normal vector (toward center) | — |
| $\rho$ | Radius of curvature | m |
| $\omega$ | Angular velocity | rad/s |
| $\alpha$ | Angular acceleration | rad/s² |

> 📐 **n-t Convention**: $\hat{e}_t$ points in direction of velocity; $\hat{e}_n$ points toward center of curvature.

## Normal-Tangential Coordinates (n-t)

For any curved path, velocity and acceleration can be decomposed:

### Velocity

$$
\boxed{\vec{v} = v \, \hat{e}_t}
$$

Velocity is always **tangent** to the path.

### Acceleration

$$
\boxed{\vec{a} = a_t \, \hat{e}_t + a_n \, \hat{e}_n}
$$

where:

$$
a_t = \frac{dv}{dt} = \dot{v} \quad \text{(tangential)}
$$

$$
a_n = \frac{v^2}{\rho} \quad \text{(normal/centripetal)}
$$

| Component | Physical Meaning | Effect |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| $a_t$ | Rate of speed change | Speeds up/slows down |
| $a_n$ | Curvature effect | Changes direction |

---

## Circular Motion (Special Case)

For circular motion with radius $r$:

$$
\rho = r \quad \text{(constant)}
$$

### Angular Relationships

| Linear | Angular | Relationship |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| $s$ | $\theta$ | $s = r\theta$ |
| $v$ | $\omega$ | $v = r\omega$ |
| $a_t$ | $\alpha$ | $a_t = r\alpha$ |

### Centripetal Acceleration

$$
\boxed{a_n = \frac{v^2}{r} = r\omega^2}
$$

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Even at constant speed ($a_t = 0$), there's still acceleration ($a_n \neq 0$) because direction changes.

---

## Polar Coordinates (r-θ)

For motion described by $(r, \theta)$:

### Velocity

$$
\vec{v} = \dot{r} \, \hat{e}_r + r\dot{\theta} \, \hat{e}_\theta
$$

where:
- $v_r = \dot{r}$ (radial)
- $v_\theta = r\dot{\theta} = r\omega$ (transverse)

### Acceleration

$$
\vec{a} = (\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2) \, \hat{e}_r + (r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}) \, \hat{e}_\theta
$$

## Common Pitfall

> ❌ **Mistake**: Thinking acceleration is zero for circular motion at constant speed.
>
> ✅ **Correct**: There's always a centripetal acceleration $a_n = v^2/r$ pointing toward the center.

> ❌ **Mistake**: Confusing tangential and normal directions.
>
> ✅ **Correct**: Tangential is along velocity; normal is perpendicular, toward center.

## Worked Example

### Example 1.3: Car on Curved Road

**Problem:** A car travels at 20 m/s on a curve of radius 100 m while accelerating at 2 m/s². Find the total acceleration magnitude.

**Solution:**

*Tangential acceleration:* $a_t = 2$ m/s²

*Normal acceleration:*
$$
a_n = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{(20)^2}{100} = 4 \text{ m/s}^2
$$

*Total acceleration:*
$$
a = \sqrt{a_t^2 + a_n^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20} = \boxed{4.47 \text{ m/s}^2}
$$

## Summary

### Key Equations

| Concept | Equation |
|---------|----------|
| Tangential acceleration | $a_t = dv/dt$ |
| Normal acceleration | $a_n = v^2/\rho$ |
| Circular motion | $v = r\omega$, $a_n = r\omega^2$ |

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Acceleration has two components: **tangential** (speed change) and **normal** (direction change)
- ✅ Normal acceleration always points toward the **center of curvature**
- ✅ For circular motion, use $a_n = v^2/r$
- ✅ Angular and linear quantities are connected by radius

In **Section 1.3: Relative Motion**, we'll analyze motion from different reference frames and calculate relative velocities.
