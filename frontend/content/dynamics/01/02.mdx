# Rigid Body Mechanics in Motion

A rigid body is an idealized representation of a solid object wherein the distance between any two given points remains constant regardless of external forces.

## Rotational Kinematics & Torque
When analyzing rigid bodies like a robotic leg joint, we must calculate the **Torque ($\tau$)**:
$$\tau = r \times F$$
Where $r$ is the moment arm vector and $F$ is the force vector.

**Ask ALGET:** Try asking the AI tutor to compare the torque required for a robotic knee joint versus the biomechanical joint of a cheetah's leg.
