## Notation & Sign Convention

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| $\sum F$ | Net force | N |
| $m$ | Mass | kg |
| $a$ | Acceleration | m/s² |

> 📐 **Convention**: Choose +x in direction of expected acceleration.

## The Equation of Motion

$$
\boxed{\sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a}}
$$

In component form (2D):

$$
\sum F_x = ma_x, \quad \sum F_y = ma_y
$$

> 💡 **Difference from Statics**: In dynamics, $\sum F \neq 0$. The net force causes acceleration!

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Step 1: Draw FBD
Show all forces on the particle.

### Step 2: Choose Coordinates
Align one axis with acceleration direction.

### Step 3: Write Equations
Apply $\sum F_x = ma_x$ and $\sum F_y = ma_y$.

### Step 4: Solve
Substitute knowns and solve for unknowns.

## Worked Example

### Example 2.1: Block on Rough Incline

**Problem:** A 10 kg block slides down a 30° incline with $\mu_k = 0.2$. Find the acceleration.

**Solution:**

*FBD (forces):*
- Weight: $W = mg = 98.1$ N (down)
- Normal: $N$ (perpendicular to surface)
- Friction: $f = \mu_k N$ (up the incline)

*Equations along incline (+x down):*
$$
\sum F_x = ma_x: \quad mg\sin 30° - \mu_k N = ma
$$

*Perpendicular to incline:*
$$
\sum F_y = 0: \quad N - mg\cos 30° = 0 \Rightarrow N = 84.9 \text{ N}
$$

*Friction:*
$$
f = 0.2 \times 84.9 = 17.0 \text{ N}
$$

*Acceleration:*
$$
a = \frac{mg\sin 30° - f}{m} = \frac{49.05 - 17.0}{10} = \boxed{3.21 \text{ m/s}^2}
$$

## Summary

- $\sum F = ma$ is the fundamental equation of dynamics
- Draw the FBD before writing equations
- Choose coordinates aligned with motion
- For friction, use $f = \mu_k N$ (kinetic) when moving

## What's Next?

In **Section 2.2: Work and Energy**, we'll use energy methods to solve problems without needing acceleration.
