## Prerequisites

`newtons_second_law` `integrals`

## Learning Objectives

1. **Calculate** work done by forces
2. **Apply** the work-energy theorem
3. **Distinguish** conservative and non-conservative forces
4. **Use** energy conservation to solve problems

## Work Done by a Force

$$
\boxed{W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \int F \cos\theta \, ds}
$$

For constant force:
$$
W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos\theta
$$

| Force Type | Work Formula |
|------------|--------------|
| Constant force | $W = Fd\cos\theta$ |
| Spring | $W = \frac{1}{2}k(x_1^2 - x_2^2)$ |
| Gravity | $W = -mg\Delta h$ |
| Friction | $W = -\mu N \cdot d$ (always negative) |

## Kinetic Energy

$$
\boxed{T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2}
$$

---

## Work-Energy Theorem

$$
\boxed{W_{net} = \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2}
$$

> 💡 **Power**: The net work equals the change in kinetic energy!

## Conservative vs Non-Conservative Forces

| Type | Examples | Work |
|------|----------|------|
| **Conservative** | Gravity, springs | Path-independent |
| **Non-conservative** | Friction, drag | Path-dependent |

For conservative forces, we define **potential energy**:
$$
W_c = -\Delta V = -(V_2 - V_1)
$$

---

## Energy Conservation

When only conservative forces act:
$$
\boxed{T_1 + V_1 = T_2 + V_2}
$$

With non-conservative work:
$$
T_1 + V_1 + W_{nc} = T_2 + V_2
$$

## Worked Example

### Example 2.3: Block Sliding Down with Friction

**Problem:** A 5 kg block slides 3 m down a 30° incline with $\mu_k = 0.2$. Starting from rest, find final speed.

**Solution:**

*Energy approach:*
$$
T_1 + V_1 + W_{friction} = T_2 + V_2
$$

$$
0 + mgh - \mu_k N \cdot d = \frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 + 0
$$

where:
- $h = 3\sin 30° = 1.5$ m
- $N = mg\cos 30° = 42.5$ N
- $W_f = -0.2 \times 42.5 \times 3 = -25.5$ J

$$
(5)(9.81)(1.5) - 25.5 = \frac{1}{2}(5)v_2^2
$$

$$
73.6 - 25.5 = 2.5 v_2^2
$$

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{19.24} = \boxed{4.39 \text{ m/s}}
$$

## Summary

- Work = Force × Distance × cos(θ)
- $W_{net} = \Delta T$ (Work-Energy Theorem)
- Conservative forces allow energy conservation
- Friction work is always negative (removes energy)

## What's Next?

In **Section 2.3: Impulse-Momentum**, we'll use momentum methods for collision and impact problems.
