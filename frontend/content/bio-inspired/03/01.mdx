# Aeroacoustics & Wing Serrations

Aeroacoustics is the branch of acoustics that studies noise generation via aerodynamic forces. 
In traditional engineering, drones generate significant high-frequency noise due to blunt trailing edge vortices.

## Bio-Inspired Inspiration: The Owl
Owls are known for their silent flight. This is biologically achieved through specialized **wing serrations** on their primary feathers.
By breaking up the large vortices into smaller, less coherent micro-turbulences, the acoustic signature is dramatically dampened.

**Concept Abstraction:**
To translate this to mechanical engineering, we map the geometric depth and angle of the bio-serrations onto the leading and trailing edges of a drone propeller layout.

**Ask ALGET:** Engage the simulation agent to launch an interactive CFD simulation comparing standard blades to serrated blades.
