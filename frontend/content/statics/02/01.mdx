## Introduction: Beyond Equilibrium of Forces

In Chapter 1, we analyzed particles where all forces act at a single point. But real structures are **rigid bodies**—they have size and shape. Forces can act at different locations, and this matters!

Consider a door: pushing near the hinge versus near the handle produces very different effects, even with the same force. The **moment** captures this rotational effect.

> 🎯 **The Big Idea**: The moment measures a force's tendency to cause rotation about a point.

## Definition of Moment

The **moment** (or **torque**) of a force about a point O is:

$$
\boxed{M_O = r \times F}
$$

where:
- $\vec{r}$ = position vector from O to any point on the line of action of $\vec{F}$
- $\vec{F}$ = the force vector
- $\times$ = cross product

### Scalar Formulation (2D)

For planar problems, the magnitude is simply:

$$
M_O = F \cdot d
$$

where $d$ is the **perpendicular distance** (moment arm) from point O to the line of action of the force.

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| $M_O$ | Moment about point O | N·m or lb·ft |
| $F$ | Force magnitude | N or lb |
| $d$ | Perpendicular distance (moment arm) | m or ft |

## Sign Convention

In 2D analysis, moments are either:

| Direction | Sign | Physical Meaning |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| Counterclockwise (CCW) | **Positive** (+) | Right-hand rule: thumb up |
| Clockwise (CW) | **Negative** (−) | Right-hand rule: thumb down |

```
        ↺ CCW = +M
        
        ↻ CW = −M
```

> 💡 **Right-Hand Rule**: Curl fingers in the direction of rotation. Your thumb points in the direction of the moment vector.

## Calculating Moments

### Method 1: Perpendicular Distance (Easiest for 2D)

$$
M_O = F \cdot d
$$

Find the perpendicular distance from O to the force's line of action.

### Method 2: Force Components (Most Common)

Break the force into components and sum their individual moments:

$$
M_O = F_x \cdot d_y - F_y \cdot d_x
$$

This is essentially **Varignon's Theorem** in practice.

### Method 3: Cross Product (General 3D)

$$
\vec{M}_O = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = \begin{vmatrix} \vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\ r_x & r_y & r_z \\ F_x & F_y & F_z \end{vmatrix}
$$

## Varignon's Theorem

> **The moment of a force about a point equals the sum of the moments of its components about that same point.**

$$
M_O(\vec{F}) = M_O(\vec{F}_x) + M_O(\vec{F}_y)
$$

This theorem simplifies calculations by allowing us to work with rectangular components.

## Worked Examples

### Example 2.1: Simple Moment Calculation

**Problem:** A 100 N force acts horizontally at point A, which is 2 m above point O. Calculate the moment about O.

```
    F = 100 N
    ●────────→  A
    │
    │ 2 m
    │
    ○ O
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Identify the moment arm*

The perpendicular distance from O to the force's line of action is $d = 2$ m.

*Step 2: Calculate the moment*

$$
M_O = F \cdot d = (100 \text{ N})(2 \text{ m}) = \boxed{200 \text{ N·m (CW)}}
$$

The force tends to rotate the system clockwise about O, so the moment is negative by convention: $M_O = -200$ N·m.

### Example 2.2: Using Components (Varignon's Theorem)

**Problem:** A 500 N force acts at 30° from horizontal at point P, located at coordinates (3, 4) m from origin O. Calculate $M_O$.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Find force components*

$$
F_x = 500 \cos(30°) = 433 \text{ N}
$$

$$
F_y = 500 \sin(30°) = 250 \text{ N}
$$

*Step 2: Apply Varignon's Theorem*

$$
M_O = F_x \cdot y - F_y \cdot x
$$

$$
M_O = (433)(4) - (250)(3)
$$

$$
M_O = 1732 - 750 = \boxed{982 \text{ N·m (CCW)}}
$$

### Example 2.3: Cross Product Method (3D)

**Problem:** Force $\vec{F} = (3\hat{i} + 4\hat{j} - 2\hat{k})$ kN acts at point A with position $\vec{r} = (1\hat{i} - 2\hat{j} + 3\hat{k})$ m from O. Find $\vec{M}_O$.

**Solution:**

$$
\vec{M}_O = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = \begin{vmatrix} \vec{i} & \vec{j} & \vec{k} \\ 1 & -2 & 3 \\ 3 & 4 & -2 \end{vmatrix}
$$

$$
\vec{M}_O = \vec{i}[(-2)(-2) - (3)(4)] - \vec{j}[(1)(-2) - (3)(3)] + \vec{k}[(1)(4) - (-2)(3)]
$$

$$
\vec{M}_O = \vec{i}[4 - 12] - \vec{j}[-2 - 9] + \vec{k}[4 + 6]
$$

$$
\vec{M}_O = \boxed{-8\hat{i} + 11\hat{j} + 10\hat{k} \text{ kN·m}}
$$

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Using any distance as moment arm | Moment arm must be **perpendicular** | Draw perpendicular from point to force line |
| Forgetting sign convention | Moments have direction | Use right-hand rule consistently |
| Adding moment magnitudes incorrectly | Moments are vectors | Add algebraically with signs |

---

## Summary

### Key Equations

| Concept | 2D Formula | 3D Formula |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Moment | $M_O = F \cdot d$ | $\vec{M}_O = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$ |
| Using components | $M_O = F_x y - F_y x$ | Determinant expansion |

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Moment measures a force's **rotational effect** about a point
- ✅ The **moment arm** is the perpendicular distance to the force's line of action
- ✅ Use **Varignon's theorem** to simplify calculations with components
- ✅ Always apply consistent **sign convention** (CCW = +, CW = −)
