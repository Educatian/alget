# Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies

> **"For a rigid body in equilibrium, both forces AND moments must balance."**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** equilibrium equations for rigid bodies
2. **Write** three equilibrium equations: ΣFx=0, ΣFy=0, ΣM=0
3. **Solve** statically determinate problems
4. **Identify** support reactions

## From Particles to Rigid Bodies

For a **particle**, we only needed force equilibrium:

$$
\sum \vec{F} = 0
$$

For a **rigid body**, we also need moment equilibrium:

$$
\sum \vec{M}_O = 0
$$

Together, these give us **6 equations in 3D** (3 force, 3 moment) or **3 equations in 2D**:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_x &= 0 \\
\sum F_y &= 0 \\
\sum M_O &= 0
\end{aligned}
}
$$

## Support Reactions

Different supports provide different reactions:

| Support Type | Reactions Provided | Diagram |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Pin/Hinge** | $R_x$, $R_y$ (2 forces) | △ |
| **Roller** | $R$ perpendicular to surface (1 force) | ○ |
| **Fixed (Cantilever)** | $R_x$, $R_y$, $M$ (2 forces + 1 moment) | ▌ |
| **Cable** | $T$ along cable (1 force, tension only) | ─ |

> 💡 **Rule**: Count unknowns. For a 2D problem, you need exactly 3 unknowns for static determinacy.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Step 1: Draw the FBD
Show all external forces including support reactions.

### Step 2: Establish Coordinate System
Usually: x horizontal (→+), y vertical (↑+), moments CCW (+).

### Step 3: Write Equilibrium Equations

$$
\sum F_x = 0, \quad \sum F_y = 0, \quad \sum M_A = 0
$$

Choose the moment point wisely—picking a point where unknown forces act eliminates those unknowns from the moment equation.

### Step 4: Solve the System
Usually 3 equations with 3 unknowns.

## Worked Examples

### Example 2.6: Simply Supported Beam

**Problem:** A 6 m beam is supported by a pin at A and a roller at B. A 1000 N load acts at the center. Find the reactions.

```
        1000 N
          ↓
    A─────C─────B
    △     3m    ○
    ├─────┼─────┤
       3m    3m
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: FBD*
- At A: $A_x$ (→), $A_y$ (↑)
- At B: $B_y$ (↑)
- Load: 1000 N (↓) at C

*Step 2: Equilibrium Equations*

**ΣFx = 0:**
$$
A_x = 0
$$

**ΣMA = 0** (taking moments about A):
$$
B_y(6) - 1000(3) = 0
$$
$$
B_y = 500 \text{ N}
$$

**ΣFy = 0:**
$$
A_y + B_y - 1000 = 0
$$
$$
A_y = 500 \text{ N}
$$

**Results:**
$$
\boxed{A_x = 0, \quad A_y = 500 \text{ N}, \quad B_y = 500 \text{ N}}
$$

### Example 2.7: Cantilever Beam

**Problem:** A 4 m cantilever beam has a fixed support at A and a 2000 N load at the free end B. Find the reactions at A.

```
    ▌═════════●
    A    4m    B
              ↓ 2000 N
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: FBD at A*
- $A_x$ (horizontal reaction)
- $A_y$ (vertical reaction)  
- $M_A$ (moment reaction)

*Step 2: Equilibrium*

**ΣFx = 0:** $A_x = 0$

**ΣFy = 0:** $A_y - 2000 = 0 \Rightarrow A_y = 2000$ N

**ΣMA = 0:** $M_A - 2000(4) = 0 \Rightarrow M_A = 8000$ N·m

**Results:**
$$
\boxed{A_x = 0, \quad A_y = 2000 \text{ N}, \quad M_A = 8000 \text{ N·m (CCW)}}
$$

In **Chapter 3: Structural Analysis**, we'll analyze trusses and frames—structures made of multiple connected members.
