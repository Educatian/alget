> **"A couple produces pure rotation—no translation. It's the purest form of rotational effect."**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Define** a couple and calculate its moment
2. **Understand** that a couple is a free vector
3. **Replace** force systems with equivalent systems
4. **Move** forces to different points using couples

## What Is a Couple?

A **couple** consists of two forces that are:
- **Equal in magnitude**
- **Opposite in direction**
- **Separated by a perpendicular distance**

$$
\boxed{M = F \cdot d}
$$

where $d$ is the perpendicular distance between the two forces.

```
         F
    ←────●
         │
         │ d
         │
    ●────→
         F
```

> 💡 **Key Property**: A couple produces **pure rotation** with no net force. The sum of forces is zero: $\vec{F} + (-\vec{F}) = 0$.

## Couple as a Free Vector

Unlike a moment about a specific point, a couple is a **free vector**—its effect is the same regardless of where it acts on the body.

| Property | Moment about a Point | Couple |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Depends on point? | Yes | **No** |
| Net force | May be non-zero | **Zero** |
| Effect | Rotation + Translation | **Pure Rotation** |
| Type | Bound vector | **Free vector** |

This means you can:
- Move a couple anywhere on the body
- Add couples algebraically
- Replace couples with other couples of the same magnitude

---

## Equivalent Force Systems

Two force systems are **equivalent** if they produce:
1. The same **resultant force**: $\sum \vec{F}_1 = \sum \vec{F}_2$
2. The same **resultant moment** about any point: $\sum M_{O,1} = \sum M_{O,2}$

### Moving a Force to a New Point

To move a force from point A to point B:

1. Add the couple $M = F \cdot d$ (where $d$ is the distance from A to B)
2. Apply the force at the new point B

$$
\text{Force at A} \equiv \text{Force at B} + \text{Couple } M
$$

## Worked Examples

### Example 2.4: Couple Moment

**Problem:** Two parallel forces of 50 N each act in opposite directions, separated by 0.4 m. Find the couple moment.

**Solution:**

$$
M = F \cdot d = (50 \text{ N})(0.4 \text{ m}) = \boxed{20 \text{ N·m}}
$$

---

### Example 2.5: Equivalent System

**Problem:** A 200 N force acts at point A, which is 1.5 m from point O. Replace this with an equivalent force-couple system at O.

**Solution:**

At point O, we need:
1. **Force**: $F = 200$ N (same direction)
2. **Couple**: $M = F \cdot d = (200)(1.5) = 300$ N·m

$$
\boxed{\text{Force: } 200 \text{ N at O} + \text{Couple: } 300 \text{ N·m}}
$$

## Summary

### Key Equations

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Couple moment | $M = F \cdot d$ |
| Equivalent system | Same $\sum F$ and same $\sum M_O$ |

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ A **couple** is two equal, opposite, non-collinear forces
- ✅ Couples produce **pure rotation** (no net force)
- ✅ A couple is a **free vector**—it can be moved anywhere
- ✅ Forces can be moved by adding an appropriate couple

## What's Next?

In **Section 2.3: Equilibrium of Rigid Bodies**, we'll apply both force and moment equilibrium to solve problems involving multiple forces at different locations.
