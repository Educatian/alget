# 6.1 Introduction to Trusses

In engineering statics, a **truss** is a structure composed of slender members joined together at their end points. Trusses are commonly used in constructing bridges, roof supports, and aerospace structures due to their high strength-to-weight ratio.

### Key Assumptions
To simplify the mathematical analysis of a truss, we make two primary assumptions:
1. **All loadings are applied at the joints.** The weight of the members is often neglected as it is small compared to the applied forces. If a weight is to be considered, it is generally applied as a force at the structural joints.
2. **The members are joined together by smooth pins.** Because of these assumptions, each truss member acts as a **two-force member**, meaning the force within the member is directed along the axis of the member (either in tension or compression).

    Human engineers didn't invent the truss. Nature has been optimizing structural frameworks for millions of years to achieve maximum strength with minimal material. For instance, the **Venus Flower Basket** (*Euplectella aspergillum*), a deep-sea glass sponge, features a complex, hierarchical silica skeleton that perfectly mirrors a reinforced truss structure to withstand deep ocean currents.

    By studying the diagonal bracing and grid-like architecture of this sponge, engineers are developing new, highly resilient structures for civil and aerospace applications. Do you want to see how this translates directly into a real-world building?

### The Method of Joints

The **Method of Joints** allows us to determine the internal forces in the various members of a truss. Since the entire truss is in equilibrium, each individual joint must also be in equilibrium.

#### Procedure for Analysis:
1. **Draw a Free-Body Diagram (FBD)** of the entire truss.
2. **Determine the external support reactions** by applying the equations of global equilibrium ($\Sigma F_x = 0$, $\Sigma F_y = 0$, $\Sigma M = 0$).
3. **Select a joint** with at least one known force and at most two unknown forces.
4. Apply the scalar equations of equilibrium ($\Sigma F_x = 0$ and $\Sigma F_y = 0$) to solve for the unknowns at that joint.
5. Proceed to the next joint and repeat the process.

**Remember:** Assume all unknown member forces are in **tension** (pulling away from the joint). If your calculated answer is negative, it means the member is actually in **compression** (pushing into the joint).
