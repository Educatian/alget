## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Define** a truss and identify its components
2. **Recognize** assumptions in truss analysis
3. **Identify** simple trusses and understand their stability
4. **Classify** trusses as statically determinate or indeterminate

## What Is a Truss?

A **truss** is a structure composed of:
- **Members**: Straight, slender elements (beams, bars)
- **Joints**: Connection points (usually pins)
- **Loads**: Applied only at joints

```

> 🏗️ **Real-World Examples**: Bridges, roof structures, towers, cranes

## Truss Assumptions

For analysis, we make these simplifying assumptions:

| Assumption | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Members connected by **frictionless pins** | Only axial forces (no moments) |
| Loads applied **only at joints** | Members are two-force members |
| Member **weight is negligible** | Simplifies calculations |
| All members are **straight** | Forces act along member axes |

> 💡 **Key Result**: Under these assumptions, every member is a **two-force member**—it experiences only tension (T) or compression (C).

---

## Tension vs. Compression

| State | Member is... | Force Direction |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tension (T)** | Being pulled apart | Away from joint |
| **Compression (C)** | Being pushed together | Toward joint |

```
Tension:      ●←─────────→●
              
Compression:  ●→─────────←●
```

## Simple Truss Construction

A **simple truss** is built by:
1. Starting with a basic triangle (3 members, 3 joints)
2. Adding 2 new members and 1 new joint at a time

This ensures the truss is:
- **Stable** (rigid, won't collapse)
- **Statically determinate** (can be solved with equilibrium alone)

### The m-2j+3 Rule

For a 2D truss to be statically determinate:

$$
\boxed{m = 2j - 3}
$$

where:
- $m$ = number of members
- $j$ = number of joints

| Condition | Classification |
|-----------|----------------|
| $m < 2j - 3$ | Unstable (mechanism) |
| $m = 2j - 3$ | Statically determinate |
| $m > 2j - 3$ | Statically indeterminate |

---

## Example: Checking Determinacy

**Problem:** A truss has 9 members and 6 joints. Is it determinate?

**Solution:**

$$
2j - 3 = 2(6) - 3 = 9
$$

Since $m = 9 = 2j - 3$, the truss is **statically determinate**. ✅

## Common Truss Types

| Name | Shape | Use |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Warren** | Equilateral triangles | Bridges |
| **Pratt** | Vertical + diagonal members | Short-span bridges |
| **Howe** | Opposite diagonal direction | Buildings |
| **K-Truss** | K-shaped panels | Long-span bridges |

---

## Zero-Force Members

Some members carry **no load** under certain conditions:

1. Two non-collinear members at an unloaded joint → Both are zero-force
2. Three members at a joint, two collinear, one not → Non-collinear is zero-force

> 🎯 **Why It Matters**: Identifying zero-force members simplifies analysis significantly.

---

## Summary

### Key Equations

$$
m = 2j - 3 \quad \text{(for static determinacy)}
$$

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Trusses consist of **members** connected at **joints**
- ✅ All truss members are **two-force members** (tension or compression only)
- ✅ Use the **m = 2j - 3** rule to check determinacy
- ✅ Identify **zero-force members** to simplify analysis

## What's Next?

In **Section 3.2: Method of Joints**, we'll learn the systematic approach to finding forces in every member of a truss.
