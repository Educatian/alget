# Method of Joints

> **"Analyze one joint at a time, and the whole truss reveals itself."**

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the method of joints to analyze trusses
2. **Draw** FBDs for individual joints
3. **Solve** for member forces systematically
4. **Determine** if members are in tension or compression

---

## The Basic Idea

The **method of joints** treats each joint as a particle in equilibrium:

$$
\sum F_x = 0, \quad \sum F_y = 0
$$

Each joint provides **2 equations**, so we can solve for up to **2 unknowns** per joint.

> 💡 **Strategy**: Start at a joint with only 2 unknown member forces (often at a support), then work through the truss joint by joint.

---

## Problem-Solving Procedure

### Step 1: Find Support Reactions
Analyze the entire truss as a rigid body to find reactions at supports.

### Step 2: Select Starting Joint
Choose a joint with **at most 2 unknown forces**.

### Step 3: Draw Joint FBD
Isolate the joint. Draw all forces:
- Known external forces/reactions
- Unknown member forces (assume tension: pointing away from joint)

### Step 4: Apply Equilibrium
$$
\sum F_x = 0, \quad \sum F_y = 0
$$

### Step 5: Interpret Results
- **Positive result**: Force is tension (T) as assumed
- **Negative result**: Force is compression (C) (reverse direction)

### Step 6: Move to Next Joint
Use the forces just found as known values at adjacent joints.

## Sign Convention

When drawing the FBD of a joint:

| Assumption | Arrow Direction | Meaning |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Tension | **Away from** joint | Member pulling on joint |
| Compression | **Toward** joint | Member pushing on joint |

> 🔑 **Standard Practice**: Always assume tension initially. If the answer is negative, the member is in compression.

## Worked Example

### Example 3.1: Simple Truss Analysis

**Problem:** Find all member forces in the truss shown.

```
              10 kN
                ↓
                C
               ╱╲
              ╱  ╲
             ╱    ╲
            A──────B
            △      ○
            
    AC = BC = 5 m, AB = 8 m
    Angle at A and B = 51.3°
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Support Reactions*

By symmetry:
$$
A_y = B_y = 5 \text{ kN}
$$
$$
A_x = 0
$$

*Step 2: Analyze Joint A*

```
        F_AC
         ↗
        ╱ 51.3°
       A●───────→ F_AB
       ↑
       5 kN
```

**ΣFy = 0:**
$$
5 + F_{AC} \sin(51.3°) = 0
$$
$$
F_{AC} = -\frac{5}{0.78} = -6.41 \text{ kN}
$$

Negative → **Compression: FAC = 6.41 kN (C)**

**ΣFx = 0:**
$$
F_{AB} + F_{AC} \cos(51.3°) = 0
$$
$$
F_{AB} = -(-6.41)(0.625) = 4.01 \text{ kN}
$$

Positive → **Tension: FAB = 4.01 kN (T)**

*Step 3: By Symmetry*

$$
F_{BC} = 6.41 \text{ kN (C)}
$$

**Final Results:**

| Member | Force | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| AC | 6.41 kN | Compression |
| BC | 6.41 kN | Compression |
| AB | 4.01 kN | Tension |

## Tips for Efficiency

1. **Exploit symmetry** when possible
2. **Identify zero-force members** first
3. **Choose smart starting joints** (supports often have few unknowns)
4. **Check your work** at the final joint (should satisfy equilibrium)

---

## Summary

### Method of Joints Procedure

1. Find support reactions
2. Start at joint with ≤2 unknowns
3. Apply $\sum F_x = 0$, $\sum F_y = 0$
4. Interpret signs (+ = T, − = C)
5. Move to adjacent joint

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Each joint is a **particle in equilibrium**
- ✅ Two equations per joint → solve 2 unknowns
- ✅ Assume **tension** initially, negative means compression
- ✅ Proceed **systematically** through the truss

## What's Next?

In **Section 3.3: Method of Sections**, we'll learn how to cut through a truss to find specific member forces directly—without analyzing every joint.
