# Method of Sections

> **"Why analyze every joint when you can cut straight to the answer?"**

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Apply** the method of sections to analyze trusses
2. **Cut** through a truss strategically
3. **Use** moment equilibrium to find specific member forces
4. **Choose** between methods for efficiency

---

## The Basic Idea

The **method of sections** involves:

1. Making an imaginary **cut** through the truss
2. Treating either section as a **rigid body** in equilibrium
3. Using **3 equilibrium equations** to solve for up to 3 unknown member forces

> 🎯 **When to Use**: When you need forces in **specific members** (especially those in the middle) without analyzing every joint.

## Method of Sections vs. Method of Joints

| Aspect | Method of Joints | Method of Sections |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Equations per step | 2 (particle) | 3 (rigid body) |
| Unknowns per step | ≤2 | ≤3 |
| Best for | All member forces | Specific members |
| Progression | Joint by joint | Direct to target |

---

## Problem-Solving Procedure

### Step 1: Find Support Reactions
Analyze the entire truss first.

### Step 2: Plan the Cut
Draw an imaginary line through the truss that:
- Passes through the **target member(s)**
- Cuts through **no more than 3 members** (usually)
- Divides the truss into two parts

### Step 3: Choose a Section
Analyze the section with **fewer forces** (simpler FBD).

### Step 4: Draw the FBD
Show:
- External forces and reactions on that section
- Internal member forces at the cut (assume tension)

### Step 5: Apply Equilibrium
$$
\sum F_x = 0, \quad \sum F_y = 0, \quad \sum M_O = 0
$$

**Pro tip**: Choose moment points that eliminate unwanted unknowns!

## Strategic Moment Points

When taking moments, choose a point where **unknown forces intersect**:

| To Find | Take Moments About |
|---------|-------------------|
| Top chord force | Point on bottom chord |
| Bottom chord force | Point on top chord |
| Diagonal force | Intersection of other two cut members |

## Worked Example

### Example 3.2: Finding a Middle Member Force

**Problem:** Find the force in member BC using the method of sections.

```
        1000 N   1000 N
          ↓        ↓
    ●─────●─────●─────●
    │╲    │    ╱│    ╱│
    │ ╲   │   ╱ │   ╱ │
    │  ╲  │  ╱  │  ╱  │
    ●─────●─────●─────●
    △                 ○
    A                 E
    
    Cut line: through BC
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Support Reactions*

$$
A_y = 1000 \text{ N}, \quad E_y = 1000 \text{ N}
$$

*Step 2: Make the Cut*

Cut through members BF, BC, and AC.

```
    Cut section (left):
    
        1000 N
          ↓
    ●─────●═══╳ F_BF
    │╲    │   
    │ ╲   │   
    │  ╲  │  F_BC
    ●─────●═══╳──→
    △     
    ↑ 1000 N
    
    (F_AC also at cut)
```

*Step 3: Take Moments about point where F_BF and F_AC intersect*

Taking moments about the bottom-left joint (A):

$$
\sum M_A = 0
$$

$$
1000(4) - F_{BC}(3) = 0
$$

$$
F_{BC} = \frac{4000}{3} = \boxed{1333 \text{ N (T)}}
$$

## When to Use Each Method

| Situation | Recommended Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Need ALL member forces | **Joints** (systematic) |
| Need ONE specific force | **Sections** (direct) |
| Forces in middle of truss | **Sections** |
| Starting point analysis | **Joints** |
| Complex geometry | Combine both |

---

## Summary

### Method of Sections Procedure

1. Find support reactions
2. Make strategic cut (≤3 members)
3. Draw FBD of one section
4. Apply $\sum F_x = 0$, $\sum F_y = 0$, $\sum M = 0$
5. Choose smart moment points

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Cut through **at most 3 members** for direct solution
- ✅ Choose **moment points** to eliminate unknowns
- ✅ Best for finding **specific member forces** quickly
- ✅ Combine with method of joints for complex trusses
