## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Identify** two-force members in a structure
2. **Apply** the two-force member principle to simplify analysis
3. **Recognize** three-force member conditions
4. **Use** concurrency for three-force equilibrium

## Introduction

In many engineering structures, certain members have special loading conditions that dramatically simplify our analysis. By recognizing **two-force** and **three-force members**, we can often determine force directions without even writing equilibrium equations.

> 🎯 **Why This Matters**: In truss analysis, nearly every member is a two-force member. Mastering this concept is essential for structural engineering.

## Two-Force Members

### Definition

A **two-force member** is a body that:

1. Has forces applied at **only two points**
2. Has **no moments** applied anywhere
3. Is in **equilibrium**

### The Two-Force Member Principle

For a two-force member in equilibrium:

> **The two forces must be:**
> - **Equal in magnitude**
> - **Opposite in direction**
> - **Collinear** (along the line connecting the two points)

This is a direct consequence of equilibrium:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \vec{F}_A = -\vec{F}_B
$$

$$
\sum M = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Forces must be collinear}
$$

### Visual Representation

```
Two-Force Member:

        F_A                           F_B
    ←────●═════════════════════════●────→
         A                         B

    • Forces at only 2 points (A and B)
    • Forces are equal, opposite, collinear
    • Member is in tension (as shown) or compression
```

### Identifying Two-Force Members

| Condition | Two-Force Member? |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Pin-connected at both ends, no other loads | ✅ Yes |
| Weight is negligible | ✅ Yes |
| Has a force applied in the middle | ❌ No |
| Has a distributed load | ❌ No |
| Supports a moment | ❌ No |

## Applications of Two-Force Members

### Trusses

In a truss, **every member** (assuming weightless) is a two-force member:

```
        P (load)
          ↓
          ●
         ╱ ╲
        ╱   ╲
       ╱     ╲
      ●───────●
      A   B   C
```

Each member (AB, BC, AC) experiences only axial force (tension or compression).

### Link Mechanisms

Connecting links in machines are typically two-force members:

```
    ●══════════●══════════●
    │          │          │
    │          │          │
   Pin        Link       Pin
```

## Worked Example: Two-Force Member

### Example 3.1: Truss Member Force Direction

**Problem:** In the truss below, identify the two-force members and determine if member BC is in tension or compression.

```
        1000 N
          ↓
          B
         ╱│╲
        ╱ │ ╲
       ╱  │  ╲
      A───┴───C
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Identify Two-Force Members*

Member BC is connected by pins at B and C only, with no intermediate loads.

$$
\text{BC is a two-force member}
$$

*Step 2: Analyze Direction*

At joint B, the 1000 N load pushes down. For equilibrium, members AB and BC must push outward (compression).

$$
F_{BC} \text{ is in } \boxed{\text{compression}}
$$

## Three-Force Members

### Definition

A **three-force member** is a body that:

1. Has forces applied at **exactly three points**
2. Is in **equilibrium**

### The Three-Force Principle

For a three-force member in equilibrium:

> **The three forces must be:**
> - **Coplanar** (in the same plane)
> - **Concurrent** (meeting at a single point) **OR**
> - **Parallel**

### Why Concurrent?

If three non-parallel forces are in equilibrium:

$$
\sum M_{\text{point}} = 0
$$

For this to be true at all points, the forces must pass through a common point.

### Visual Representation

```
Three-Force Member:

              F₁
               ↓
        ●──────●
       ╱        ╲
      ╱     O    ╲     ← Concurrent point
     ↙            ↘
   F₂              F₃

   All three forces meet at point O
```

---

## Worked Example: Three-Force Member

### Example 3.2: Beam with Three Forces

**Problem:** A beam is supported by a pin at A and a roller at B, with a concentrated load P at point C. Determine the direction of the reaction at A.

```
        P
        ↓
    ●───C───●
    A       B
    △       ○
```

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Identify Forces*

Three forces act on the beam:
1. Load $P$ at C (vertical, down)
2. Reaction $R_B$ at B (vertical, up - roller)
3. Reaction $R_A$ at A (unknown direction)

*Step 2: Apply Three-Force Principle*

Since $P$ and $R_B$ are both vertical (parallel), $R_A$ must also be vertical for equilibrium.

Alternatively: The three forces must be concurrent. Since two are parallel, the third must also be parallel.

$$
R_A \text{ is vertical}
$$

## Comparison Table

| Property | Two-Force Member | Three-Force Member |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Number of force points | 2 | 3 |
| Force requirement | Equal, opposite, collinear | Concurrent or parallel |
| Common examples | Truss members, links | Beams, frames |
| Known before solving | Force direction | Force must pass through common point |

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### When You See Two Force Points:

1. Check: Is it truly a two-force member?
2. If yes: Forces act along the line connecting the two points
3. Member is either in **tension** or **compression**

### When You See Three Force Points:

1. Identify the lines of action of any known forces
2. Find where two known forces intersect
3. The third force must pass through this intersection point

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ **Two-force members** have forces at only two points → forces are collinear
- ✅ **Three-force members** have forces at three points → forces are concurrent
- ✅ Recognizing these special cases **simplifies analysis significantly**
- ✅ Most truss members are two-force members
- ✅ Use the three-force principle to find unknown force directions

### Quick Reference

| Member Type | Condition | Consequence |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Two-Force | 2 force points only | Forces along line AB |
| Three-Force | 3 force points | Forces meet at one point |
