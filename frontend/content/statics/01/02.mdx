## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Draw** complete and accurate free body diagrams
2. **Identify** all forces acting on an isolated body
3. **Apply** the systematic 6-step FBD procedure
4. **Recognize** common FBD errors and how to avoid them

## Why Free Body Diagrams Matter

In the previous section, we learned that equilibrium requires $\sum \vec{F} = 0$. But how do we know which forces to include in that sum?

The answer is the **Free Body Diagram (FBD)**—the most important problem-solving tool in all of mechanics.

> 🎯 **The Truth About Statics**: Most errors in statics problems don't come from math mistakes. They come from **incomplete or incorrect FBDs**. Master the FBD, and you'll master statics.

## What Is a Free Body Diagram?

A **free body diagram** is a simplified sketch that shows:

1. The **body of interest**, isolated from everything else
2. **All external forces** acting on that body
3. A **coordinate system** for reference

### The Key Principle: Isolation

The word "free" in free body diagram means the body is **freed from its surroundings**. We mentally "cut" the object away from everything it touches, then replace each connection with the force it exerts.

| What You Remove | What You Draw Instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Cable/rope | Tension force along cable |
| Surface contact | Normal force (perpendicular) |
| Rough surface | Normal + Friction forces |
| Pin/hinge | Reaction forces (Rx, Ry) |
| Fixed support | Reactions + Moment |

## The 6-Step FBD Procedure

Follow this systematic procedure for every problem:

### Step 1: Identify the Body

Clearly define what object you're analyzing. Draw it as a simple shape (dot, box, or line).

### Step 2: Isolate the Body

Mentally "cut" the body free from its surroundings. Remove all cables, supports, and contacts.

### Step 3: Establish Coordinates

Draw x and y axes. Usually:
- **x**: horizontal (positive right)
- **y**: vertical (positive up)

For inclined surfaces, consider rotating axes.

### Step 4: Draw the Weight

Every object with mass has weight:

$$
W = mg
$$

Always draw weight pointing **straight down** (toward Earth's center).

### Step 5: Draw Contact and Connection Forces

At every point where you "cut" a connection:

| Connection Type | Force to Draw |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Cable/Rope | $T$ along cable, away from body |
| Smooth surface | $N$ perpendicular to surface |
| Rough surface | $N$ perpendicular + $f$ parallel |
| Pin support | $R_x$ and $R_y$ (unknown directions) |

### Step 6: Label Everything

Use symbols ($T$, $N$, $W$, $R$) and include:
- Known magnitudes
- Unknown variables
- Angles

## Force Identification Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you don't miss any forces:

| Category | Check | Common Forces |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| ✅ Gravity | Does it have mass? | Weight $W = mg$ |
| ✅ Cables | Is anything attached by rope/cable? | Tension $T$ |
| ✅ Surfaces | Is it touching any surface? | Normal $N$, Friction $f$ |
| ✅ Supports | Is it connected to ground/wall? | Reactions $R_x$, $R_y$ |
| ✅ Applied | Are external forces mentioned? | Push/Pull $P$ |

## Common FBD Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Missing the Weight

**Wrong:**
```
    T₁       T₂
     ↖     ↗
      ╲   ╱
       ╲ ╱
        ●
```

**Correct:**
```
    T₁       T₂
     ↖     ↗
      ╲   ╱
       ╲ ╱
        ●
        │
        ↓ W
```

> ⚠️ **Every object with mass has weight!** This is the most common mistake beginners make.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Tension Direction

**Wrong:** Tension pointing toward the object
```
        ← T
        ●
```

**Correct:** Tension pointing away from the object (cables **pull**)
```
        T →
        ●
```

### Mistake 3: Including Internal Forces

If analyzing a system of connected objects, don't draw internal forces that cancel out.

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Reaction Forces

At every support, there must be a reaction force to maintain equilibrium.

## Worked Examples

### Example 2.1: Block on Inclined Plane

**Problem:** A 20 kg block rests on a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane at 30° to the horizontal. Draw the FBD.

**Solution:**

*Step 1-2: Identify and Isolate*

The block is our body of interest. We remove the inclined surface.

*Step 3: Coordinates*

Use standard axes or rotate to align with the incline:

```
        y
        ↑
        │  ╱
        │ ╱ N
        │╱θ
        ●───→ x
       ╱│
      ╱ │
     ╱  ↓ W
    ╱
   ╱ 30°
```

*Step 4-5: Forces*

| Force | Magnitude | Direction |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Weight $W$ | $(20)(9.81) = 196.2$ N | Straight down |
| Normal $N$ | Unknown | Perpendicular to surface |

*Step 6: Complete FBD*

$$
W = mg = 196.2 \text{ N}
$$

The normal force $N$ balances the component of weight perpendicular to the surface.

### Example 2.2: Pulley System

**Problem:** A 50 kg mass hangs from a rope that passes over a frictionless pulley. Draw the FBD of the mass and the pulley.

**Solution:**

*FBD of the Mass:*

```
    ↑ T
    │
    ● mass
    │
    ↓ W = 490.5 N
```

*FBD of the Pulley:*

```
        ↑ R (support reaction)
        │
        ○ pulley
       ╱ ╲
      ↓   ↓
      T   T
```

**Key Insight:** For a frictionless pulley, the tension is the same on both sides of the rope.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ The FBD is your **most important tool** in statics
- ✅ Always **isolate** the body from its surroundings
- ✅ Replace connections with appropriate **force vectors**
- ✅ Use the **6-step procedure** systematically
- ✅ Check your work with the **force identification checklist**

### FBD Quality Checklist

Before solving, verify:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| ☐ | Is the body clearly isolated? |
| ☐ | Is weight included (if the body has mass)? |
| ☐ | Are all contact forces shown? |
| ☐ | Do tension forces point away from the body? |
| ☐ | Are all forces labeled with symbols? |
| ☐ | Is a coordinate system defined? |
