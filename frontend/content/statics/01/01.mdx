## Opening: Why Equilibrium Matters

On November 7, 1940, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed spectacularly—not because of a calculation error in equilibrium, but because engineers underestimated dynamic forces. This failure reminds us: **understanding equilibrium is the foundation of structural safety**.

Every structure around you—from the chair you're sitting in to the building housing this classroom—remains standing because the forces acting on it are in **equilibrium**. When equilibrium fails, structures fail.

> 🎯 **The Big Picture**: Mastering equilibrium analysis gives you the power to predict whether a structure will stand or fall, whether a cable will hold or snap, whether a system is safe or dangerous.

    While human engineers struggle with dynamic loads like wind or rushing water, nature has perfected equilibrium under stress. Consider the <strong>Mangrove tree</strong>.<br/><br/>
    Instead of a single, rigid taproot that might snap under the force of a tidal wave or hurricane, mangroves utilize a complex network of "prop roots." These roots distribute dynamic forces perfectly, maintaining static equilibrium for the main trunk even when battered by severe storms. By learning how mangroves distribute force, we can design better, more resilient deep-sea drilling platforms and coastal buildings.

## What Is Equilibrium?

### The Physical Concept

Imagine a book resting on a table. It doesn't accelerate—it just sits there. Why? Because all the forces acting on it **cancel out perfectly**. The table pushes up with exactly the same force that gravity pulls down.

This is **equilibrium**: a state where the net effect of all forces is zero.

| State | Condition | Physical Meaning |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Static Equilibrium | $\sum \vec{F} = 0$ and $v = 0$ | Object at rest, stays at rest |
| Dynamic Equilibrium | $\sum \vec{F} = 0$ and $v = \text{const}$ | Moving at constant velocity |

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Equilibrium doesn't mean "no forces"—it means all forces **balance** each other exactly.

### The Particle Model

In this chapter, we model objects as **particles**—points where all forces act at a single location. This simplification is valid when:

- The object's size is small compared to other dimensions in the problem
- Rotational effects can be ignored
- We only care about translational equilibrium

---

## The Equilibrium Condition

### Vector Form

For a particle in equilibrium, the **vector sum** of all forces equals zero:

$$
\boxed{\sum \vec{F} = 0}
$$

This single elegant equation is Newton's First Law applied to statics.

### Component Form

In practice, we work with components. For 2D problems:

$$
\sum F_x = 0 \quad \text{(horizontal forces balance)}
$$

$$
\sum F_y = 0 \quad \text{(vertical forces balance)}
$$

> ⚠️ **Critical**: These are **algebraic** sums. Forces in the negative direction carry a **negative sign**. Sign errors are the #1 source of wrong answers!

## Forces in Equilibrium Problems

Before solving problems, you must identify **all** forces acting on your particle:

| Force Type | Symbol | Direction | When Does It Act? |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Weight | $W$ or $mg$ | Always **down** | Always, on any object with mass |
| Tension | $T$ | Along cable, **away from** object | Connected to cables, ropes |
| Normal | $N$ | **Perpendicular** to surface | Object touches a surface |
| Friction | $f$ | **Parallel** to surface | Surfaces with friction |
| Applied | $P$ or $F$ | As specified | External forces |

> 📌 **Golden Rule for Tension**: Cables can only **pull**—never push. Tension always acts **away** from the object along the cable's direction.

## Free Body Diagrams: The Master Skill

The **Free Body Diagram (FBD)** is the most important skill in statics. A correct FBD leads to correct solutions.

### 6-Step FBD Procedure

1. **Isolate** the body of interest
2. **Establish** a coordinate system (x horizontal, y vertical)
3. **Draw weight** acting downward through the center
4. **Draw tension** forces along each cable, away from object
5. **Draw normal and friction** forces at contact surfaces
6. **Label** all forces with symbols

## Worked Examples

### Example 1.1: Vertical Hanging Weight (Basic)

**Problem:** A 25 kg lamp hangs from a vertical cable. Find the tension.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Draw the FBD*

```
    ↑ T (tension)
    │
    ● lamp
    │
    ↓ W = mg
```

*Step 2: Apply equilibrium*

$$
\sum F_y = 0
$$

$$
T - W = 0
$$

$$
T = W = mg
$$

*Step 3: Calculate*

$$
T = (25 \text{ kg})(9.81 \text{ m/s}^2) = \boxed{245.25 \text{ N}}
$$

### Example 1.2: Single Inclined Cable (Classic)

**Problem:** A 50 kg crate is suspended by a cable at 45° from horizontal. Find the tension.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Draw the FBD*

```
              T
             ↗
            ╱  θ = 45°
           ╱
          ● crate
          │
          ↓ W = mg
```

*Step 2: Resolve tension into components*

| Component | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| $T_x$ | $T \cos(45°)$ |
| $T_y$ | $T \sin(45°)$ |

*Step 3: Apply vertical equilibrium*

$$
\sum F_y = 0
$$

$$
T \sin(45°) - mg = 0
$$

$$
T = \frac{mg}{\sin(45°)}
$$

*Step 4: Calculate*

$$
T = \frac{(50)(9.81)}{0.707} = \frac{490.5}{0.707} = \boxed{693.67 \text{ N}}
$$

**Significance:** Notice that $T > W$! The tension (693.67 N) exceeds the weight (490.5 N) because only the **vertical component** of tension supports the weight.

> 🧠 **Think About It**: What happens as θ approaches 0° (horizontal cable)? The required tension approaches infinity! This is why you can never string a cable perfectly horizontal under load.

### Example 1.3: Two-Cable System (Challenging)

**Problem:** A 100 kg crate is suspended by two cables. Cable A makes 30° with horizontal, Cable B makes 60° with horizontal (opposite sides). Find $T_A$ and $T_B$.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Write equilibrium equations*

**Horizontal** ($\sum F_x = 0$):

$$
T_A \cos(30°) - T_B \cos(60°) = 0
$$

$$
T_A (0.866) = T_B (0.5)
$$

$$
T_A = 0.577 \, T_B \quad \text{...(1)}
$$

**Vertical** ($\sum F_y = 0$):

$$
T_A \sin(30°) + T_B \sin(60°) - W = 0
$$

$$
T_A (0.5) + T_B (0.866) = 981 \quad \text{...(2)}
$$

*Step 2: Solve the system*

Substitute (1) into (2):

$$
(0.577 \, T_B)(0.5) + T_B (0.866) = 981
$$

$$
0.289 \, T_B + 0.866 \, T_B = 981
$$

$$
1.155 \, T_B = 981
$$

$$
T_B = \boxed{849.4 \text{ N}}
$$

From equation (1):

$$
T_A = 0.577 \times 849.4 = \boxed{490.1 \text{ N}}
$$
