## Notation & Sign Convention

| Symbol | Meaning | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| $N$ | Normal force | N |
| $F_s$ | Static friction force | N |
| $F_k$ | Kinetic friction force | N |
| $\mu_s$ | Static friction coefficient | dimensionless |
| $\mu_k$ | Kinetic friction coefficient | dimensionless |

> 📐 **Direction Convention**: Friction always opposes *relative motion* or *tendency to move*.

## What Is Friction?

**Friction** is a force that resists the relative motion (or tendency of motion) between two surfaces in contact.

```
        Applied Force P →
        ┌─────────────┐
        │    Block    │ → Tends to move right
        └─────────────┘
        ← f (friction)
    ════════════════════
          Surface
```

> 💡 **Key Insight**: Friction acts **parallel** to the contact surface, opposing the direction of (intended) motion.

## Static vs. Kinetic Friction

| Property | Static Friction ($F_s$) | Kinetic Friction ($F_k$) |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| When | Object at rest | Object moving |
| Range | $0 \leq F_s \leq \mu_s N$ | $F_k = \mu_k N$ (constant) |
| Coefficient | $\mu_s$ (higher) | $\mu_k$ (lower) |
| Key point | **Variable** up to max | **Fixed** value |

### The Critical Relationship

$$
\boxed{F_s \leq \mu_s N}
$$

Static friction **adjusts** to match the applied force—until it reaches its maximum.

$$
(F_s)_{\max} = \mu_s N
$$

> ⚠️ **Common Pitfall**: Don't assume $F_s = \mu_s N$ always! The equality holds **only** at impending motion.

---

## Impending Motion

**Impending motion** is the condition when an object is *just about to slip*.

At impending motion:
- $F_s = (F_s)_{\max} = \mu_s N$
- The block is still stationary, but any additional force would cause slipping

### Sign of Impending Motion

Before solving, you must **assume a direction** of impending motion:
1. Guess which way the object tends to slide
2. Draw friction opposing that direction
3. Solve and check: if $P > 0$, your assumption was correct

---

## Friction Force Direction

> 🎯 **Rule**: Friction always **opposes the relative motion** or **tendency to move**.

| Situation | Friction Direction |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Block pushed right | Friction points left ← |
| Block slides down incline | Friction points up incline ↗ |
| Block about to tip | Friction opposes horizontal motion |

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1.4: Block on Horizontal Surface

**Problem:** A 50 kg block rests on a horizontal surface with $\mu_s = 0.4$. What horizontal force $P$ is required to cause impending motion?

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Draw FBD*

```
          P →
    ┌─────────────┐
    │   50 kg     │
    └─────────────┘
    ↑N    ← f
    ════════════════
          ↓ W
```

*Step 2: Find Normal Force*

$$
\sum F_y = 0: \quad N - W = 0
$$
$$
N = mg = (50)(9.81) = 490.5 \text{ N}
$$

*Step 3: Maximum Friction*

$$
(F_s)_{\max} = \mu_s N = (0.4)(490.5) = 196.2 \text{ N}
$$

*Step 4: At Impending Motion*

$$
P = (F_s)_{\max} = \boxed{196.2 \text{ N}}
$$

### Example 1.5: Block on Inclined Plane (Impending Slip Down)

**Problem:** A block rests on a 30° incline with $\mu_s = 0.5$. Will it slip?

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Components along incline*

- Weight component down incline: $W_{\parallel} = mg\sin(30°)$
- Weight component into incline: $W_{\perp} = mg\cos(30°)$

*Step 2: Normal force*

$$
N = mg\cos(30°)
$$

*Step 3: Maximum friction*

$$
(F_s)_{\max} = \mu_s N = \mu_s mg\cos(30°)
$$

*Step 4: Compare forces*

For equilibrium: friction must balance weight component down incline.

$$
\text{Required: } F_s = mg\sin(30°)
$$

$$
\text{Available: } (F_s)_{\max} = (0.5)mg\cos(30°) = 0.433mg
$$

$$
\text{Required: } mg\sin(30°) = 0.5mg
$$

Since $0.433mg < 0.5mg$, maximum friction is **insufficient**.

$$
\boxed{\text{The block will slip!}}
$$

## Common Pitfall

> ❌ **Mistake**: Assuming $F = \mu N$ for all friction problems.
>
> ✅ **Correct**: Use $F_s \leq \mu_s N$ for statics. The equality holds **only at impending motion**.

## Unit Check

| Calculation | Units Check |
|-------------|-------------|
| $\mu N$ | (dimensionless)(N) = N ✓ |
| $mg\sin\theta$ | (kg)(m/s²) = N ✓ |

---

## Sanity Check

- Higher $\mu_s$ → harder to start motion ✓
- Higher $N$ → more friction ✓
- At $\theta = 0°$ (horizontal), $N = mg$ and friction can be up to $\mu_s mg$ ✓

---

## Mini Check

> **Quick Question**: A 100 N block sits on a surface with $\mu_s = 0.3$. What is the maximum static friction force possible?
>
> **Answer**: $(F_s)_{\max} = 0.3 \times 100 = 30$ N

## Summary

### Key Equations

| Condition | Equation |
|-----------|----------|
| Static friction | $F_s \leq \mu_s N$ |
| Kinetic friction | $F_k = \mu_k N$ |
| At impending motion | $F_s = \mu_s N$ |

### Key Takeaways

- ✅ Friction **opposes** motion or the tendency to move
- ✅ Static friction is **variable**: $0 \leq F_s \leq \mu_s N$
- ✅ Use $F_s = \mu_s N$ **only at impending motion**
- ✅ Always draw the **FBD** and identify friction direction first
