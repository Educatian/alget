## Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), developed by John Sweller, suggests that working memory has a limited capacity. Instructional design should aim to optimize this capacity to maximize learning.

### Types of Cognitive Load

There are three main types of cognitive load:

1. **Intrinsic Cognitive Load**: The inherent difficulty of the material itself. This cannot be changed by the instructor, but it can be managed by breaking complex topics into smaller parts.
2. **Extraneous Cognitive Load**: Load generated by the manner in which information is presented to learners. This is under the control of the instructional designer and should be minimized (e.g., poorly designed interfaces, distracting animations).
3. **Germane Cognitive Load**: The load devoted to processing, constructing, and automating *schemas*. This is the "good" cognitive load that leads to learning.

## Schema Theory

Cognitive load theory relies heavily on **schema theory**. A schema is a cognitive construct that organizes elements of information into a single concept.

- **Novices** treat every piece of information as a separate element in working memory.
- **Experts** have developed complex schemas, allowing them to treat multiple interacting elements as a single unit in working memory, bypassing its limitations.

  question="A designer adds loud background music and unnecessary spinning animations to a tutorial. According to Cognitive Load Theory, what type of load are they primarily increasing?" 
  options='[{"text":"Intrinsic Load", "isCorrect":false},{"text":"Germane Load", "isCorrect":false},{"text":"Extraneous Load", "isCorrect":true}]' 
  explanation="Exactly! Extraneous load refers to unnecessary cognitive effort forced on the learner by poor instructional design or distracting visual/audio elements."
