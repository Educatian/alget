## Constructivism

Constructivism is a learning theory that posits learners actively "construct" their own meaning and knowledge rather than passively receiving information from an instructor.

Foundational theorists include **Jean Piaget** (Social Constructivism) and **Lev Vygotsky** (Zone of Proximal Development).

### Key Principles

1. **Active Learning**: Learning involves active engagement, problem-solving, and critical thinking.
2. **Social Interaction**: Social interaction and collaboration are central to the learning process. Knowledge is co-constructed.
3. **Context is Crucial**: Learning should occur in authentic, real-world contexts that reflect how the knowledge will be used.

### Active Learning Strategies in Design

When designing instruction from a constructivist perspective, designers often incorporate:

- Problem-Based Learning (PBL)
- Collaborative group projects
- Socratic questioning and discussion
- Scenario-based simulations
