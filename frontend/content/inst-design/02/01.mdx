## The ADDIE Framework

The ADDIE model is the generic process traditionally used by instructional designers and training developers. The five phases—**Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation**—represent a dynamic, flexible guideline for building effective training and performance support tools.

## The Analysis Phase

Before creating any content, designers must understand the fundamental "why," "who," and "what." 

*   **Learner Analysis:** Who are the students? What is their prior knowledge? Do they have specific cognitive loads we need to account for?
*   **Context Analysis:** What is the learning environment? Are we designing for a high-bandwidth university or a low-bandwidth remote setting?
*   **Task/Content Analysis:** What specific skills or knowledge must be acquired?

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Insight:** It is crucial to remember that the Analysis phase isn't just about the learner's background; it is fundamentally about identifying the actual performance gap. Is the issue rooted in a lack of skill, or is it a motivation problem?

## The Design Phase

Once the analysis is complete, the design phase involves creating a blueprint for the instruction. During this phase, instructional designers will outline:

1.  **Learning Objectives:** Using frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy.
2.  **Assessment Instruments:** Determining how we will measure success (aligned to the objectives).
3.  **Media Selection:** Choosing whether to use video, text, interactive simulations, etc.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the transition between Analysis and Design feels iterative. The Design phase often reveals gaps in the Analysis that need to be revisited.

  options='[{"text":"Analysis", "isCorrect":false},{"text":"Design", "isCorrect":true},{"text":"Development", "isCorrect":false}]' 
  explanation="Correct! The Design phase serves as the blueprint, where objectives, assessments, and media are formally selected before actual production begins."
