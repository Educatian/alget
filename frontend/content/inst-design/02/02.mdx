## The Development Phase

In the Development phase, instructional designers and developers create and assemble the content assets that were blueprinted in the design phase.

1.  **Drafting Content:** Writing the actual text, scripts for videos, and creating assessments.
2.  **Asset Creation:** Building graphics, recording audio, and programming interactive eLearning modules.
3.  **Alpha/Beta Testing:** Conducting QA testing to ensure there are no bugs and that the learning flow makes sense.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Insight:** It is important to emphasize that 'Development' doesn't just mean coding or software engineering. Writing a textbook module or drafting a script is also considered 'development' in this context!

## The Implementation Phase

The implementation phase is where the course is delivered to the learners. It requires preparation and logistical management.

*   **Training the Trainers:** If it's instructor-led, the instructors must be trained on the curriculum.
*   **Preparing the Learners:** Setting up accounts, providing orientations, and ensuring users have the necessary tools to access the course (e.g., LMS access).
*   **Launching:** Making the course live. Check that the learning environment is functional.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Common Pitfall:** A frequent failure point in the Implementation phase is tech infrastructure failing under load on day one. Always emphasize load testing and having helpdesk availability ready.
