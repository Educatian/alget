## The Evaluation Phase

Evaluation is the final phase of the ADDIE model, although in modern iterative design (like SAM or Agile), evaluation happens continuously throughout the process. Measurement determines the effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction.

### Formative vs. Summative Evaluation

*   **Formative Evaluation:** Occurs *during* the development of the course. It allows you to catch errors or misunderstandings early (e.g., peer reviews, alpha testing).
*   **Summative Evaluation:** Occurs *after* the course has been implemented. It measures whether the overall goals of the learning intervention were met.

### Kirkpatrick's 4 Levels of Evaluation

A gold standard in the industry for summative evaluation:

1.  **Reaction:** Did the learners enjoy the training? Was it relevant? (Often called "smile sheets").
2.  **Learning:** Did they acquire the intended knowledge, skills, or attitudes? (Measured via assessments).
3.  **Behavior:** Did they apply what they learned when they went back to their job? (Measured via observation).
4.  **Results:** Did the training impact the bottom line of the organization? (e.g., increased sales, fewer errors).

> **Measurement Reality Check:** Levels 3 and 4 are famously difficult to track accurately in traditional classroom settings. For our engineering textbook module context, we primarily rely on Level 2 (Diagnostic Assessments) combined with behavioral trace logs (time on task, interaction rates) to simulate deeper evaluation metrics.

  options='[{"text":"Level 1: Reaction", "isCorrect":false},{"text":"Level 2: Learning", "isCorrect":false},{"text":"Level 3: Behavior", "isCorrect":true}]' 
  explanation="Correct! Level 3 (Behavior) evaluates whether the learning transferred to actual on-the-job performance."
