# ALGET CW Task Definitions

## 4 Core Tasks — Tailored for ALGET Intelligent Textbook

---

## Task Design Principles

> In CW, **"Task selection determines the quality of the evaluation."** Each task must have clear starting preconditions and success criteria (Wharton et al., 1994).

The core learning flow of ALGET is decomposed into 4 tasks:

1. Entry and Content Navigation
2. AI-based Inquiry and Result Interpretation
3. Interpreting and Applying Scaffolding/Feedback
4. Operating Simulations and Verifying Learning

| **Scenario** | "A 1st-year Mechanical Engineering student needs to study the 'Equilibrium Conditions' for their Statics course. They log into ALGET for the first time and must navigate to Statics Chapter 1, Section 1.1." |
| **Precondition** | User is on the ALGET Dashboard. No prior experience with the system. |
| **Success Criterion** | The content for Section 1.1 is displayed on the screen, and the 'Learning Objectives' are clearly visible. |
| **Failure Definition** | Fails to reach Statics 1.1 within 3 minutes, or enters the wrong course/section. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **0** | **(First Impression)** | *Observe the screen for 3 seconds* | Overall layout, initial branding |
| 1 | Understand the system's purpose | Read the introduction/welcome area on the Dashboard | Header, Welcome message |
| 2 | Locate the 'Statics' course | Click "Statics" from the course menu/cards | Statics/Dynamics labels, icons |

## Task T2: Bio-Design Lab Inquiry & AI Interpretation

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T2 |
| **Task Name** | Bio-Design Lab Inquiry & AI Interpretation |
| **Scenario** | "While learning about Equilibrium, the student wonders about examples in nature. They go to the Bio-Design Lab and submit the question: **'What biological structures perfectly demonstrate static equilibrium?'** They must then interpret the AI's synthesized response." |
| **Precondition** | The user is actively reading Section 1.1. The Bio-Design Lab is accessible. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Successfully submits the question, (2) Distinguishes between the Biology Context and Engineering Application cards, and (3) Understands the connection presented in the Synthesis area. |
| **Failure Definition** | Cannot find how to input the question, fails to grasp the distinction between the biological and engineering analyses, or ignores the Synthesis entirely. |

*Note: The exact question is pre-defined to ensure comparability across all experts. If you feel a novice would struggle to formulate this question, record that as an Issue.*

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Navigate to Bio-Design Lab | Click "Bio-Design Lab" in the menu/UI | Menu item, DNA icon (🧬) |
| 2 | Input the question | Type the prompt and click "Generate" | Input placeholder, Generate button |
| 3 | Wait for AI generation | Observe loading state | Spinner, "Thinking..." text |
| 4 | Check Intent classification | Read the "Detected Intent" badge | Intent Badge (e.g., "EXPLORE") |
| 5 | Read the Synthesis | Read the synthesis text connecting biology and engineering | "Synthesis" header, Markdown text |
| 6 | Review Biology Context | Examine the Biology Card (principles, examples) | Card title, biological images/icons |
| 7 | Review Engineering Application | Examine the Engineering Card (mechanics analysis) | Card title, FBDs, formulas |

## Task T3: Interpreting Scaffolding & Validation Feedback

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T3 |
| **Task Name** | Interpreting Scaffolding & Validation Feedback |
| **Scenario** | "Continuing from T2, the student sees the Scaffolding block generated by the Tutor Agent, and the Validation/Critique block from Janine (evaluating against Life's Principles). The student must interpret this feedback and decide what to do next." |
| **Precondition** | The AI response from T2 is fully rendered on screen, including the Scaffolding and Validation blocks. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Understands the pedagogical intent of the Tutor's Socratic question, (2) Interprets the Pass/Fail grades and remarks in Janine's Validation badge, and (3) Identifies a clear next action to take. |
| **Failure Definition** | Ignores the scaffolding question, cannot understand Janine's validation metrics, or experiences "dead-end" confusion about what to do next. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Locate Scaffolding Area | Scroll to find the Scaffolding Card | "Scaffolding" header, question mark icon |
| 2 | Comprehend Tutor's intent | Read the Socratic question and mentally formulate an answer | Question-formatted text, hints |
| 3 | Locate Validation Area | Scroll to find the Validation Badge | Validation label, Pass/Fail indicators |
| 4 | Review Janine's criteria | Check the scores/status for each Life's Principle | Scores, color coding (Green/Red) |
| 5 | Interpret the critique | Read the text to understand "why" the score was given | Explanatory text, actionable suggestions |
| 6 | Determine next action | Decide whether to (a) refine prompt, (b) return to content, or (c) ask a new question | UI navigation links, text input box |

## Task T4: Operating Simulations & Verifying Learning

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T4 |
| **Task Name** | Operating Simulations & Verifying Learning |
| **Scenario** | "The student notices an interactive simulation block generated by the Engineer Agent. They must manipulate the simulation to verify the equilibrium concepts visually, and successfully link this physical intuition back to the core concept ($\Sigma F=0$)." |
| **Precondition** | The Simulation block is visible within the AI response. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Successfully loads and interacts with the simulation, (2) Correctly associates the visual changes with the underlying mechanics ($\Sigma F=0$), and (3) Connects the experience back to the textbook content. |
| **Failure Definition** | Does not know how to interact with the simulation, misinterprets the visual feedback, or fails to see how it relates to the learning objective. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Locate Simulation Area | Scroll to find the Simulation Frame | "Simulation" header, iframe/canvas |
| 2 | Understand simulation purpose | Read the Description text | Description label |
| 3 | Manipulate the simulation | Interact with sliders, buttons, or draggable nodes | UI controls within the simulation |
| 4 | Observe visual feedback | Watch changes in force vectors, structural deformation, etc. | Animations, vector arrows, real-time values |
| 5 | Review Concepts Shown | Read the list of engineering concepts tied to the simulation | "Concepts" tag/label list |
| 6 | Link back to content | Connect the visual result mentally to Section 1.1's $\Sigma F=0$ | Navigation buttons (e.g., "Return to Content") |

## Appendix: Optional Task

### Task T5 (Optional): Search and Explore (CWW Perspective)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T5 (Optional) |

| **Precondition** | User is anywhere within the ALGET system. |
| **Success Criterion** | Reaches Statics Chapter 1, Section 1.4 (Friction). |
| **Failure Definition** | Fails to locate the specific section within 5 minutes. |

> *Note: By Blackmon et al.'s (2002) Cognitive Walkthrough for the Web (CWW), this tests "Information Scent"—how well the UI labels match the user's semantic goal.*
