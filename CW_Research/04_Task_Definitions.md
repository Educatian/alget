# ALGET CW Task Definitions

## 4 Core Tasks — Tailored for ALGET Intelligent Textbook

---

## Task Design Principles

> In CW, **"Task selection determines the quality of the evaluation."** Each task must have clear starting preconditions and success criteria (Wharton et al., 1994).

The core learning flow of ALGET is decomposed into 4 tasks:

1. Entry and Content Navigation
2. AI-based Inquiry and Result Interpretation
3. Interpreting and Applying Scaffolding/Feedback
4. Operating Simulations and Verifying Learning

| **Precondition** | User is on the ALGET Dashboard. No prior experience with the system. |
| **Success Criterion** | The content for Section 1.1 is displayed on the screen, and the 'Learning Objectives' are clearly visible. |
| **Failure Definition** | Fails to reach Chapter 1, Section 1.1 within 3 minutes, or enters the wrong module. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **0** | **(First Impression)** | *Observe the screen for 3 seconds* | Overall layout, initial branding |

## Task T2: Bio-Design Lab Inquiry & AI Interpretation

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T2 |
| **Task Name** | Learning Design Lab Inquiry & AI Interpretation |
| **Scenario** | "While learning about Constructivism, the student wonders about practical applications in digital environments. They go to the Learning Design Lab and submit the question: **'What are specific examples of constructivist learning environments online?'** They must then interpret the AI's synthesized response." |
| **Precondition** | The user is actively reading Section 1.1. The Learning Design Lab is accessible. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Successfully submits the question, (2) Distinguishes between the Theoretical Context and Practical Application cards, and (3) Understands the connection presented in the Synthesis area. |
| **Failure Definition** | Cannot find how to input the question, fails to grasp the distinction between theory and practice, or ignores the Synthesis entirely. |

*Note: The exact question is pre-defined to ensure comparability across all experts. If you feel a novice would struggle to formulate this question, record that as an Issue.*

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Navigate to Learning Design Lab | Click "Learning Design Lab" in the menu/UI | Menu item, Lab icon |
| 2 | Input the question | Type the prompt and click "Generate" | Input placeholder, Generate button |
| 3 | Wait for AI generation | Observe loading state | Spinner, "Thinking..." text |
| 4 | Check Intent classification | Read the "Detected Intent" badge | Intent Badge (e.g., "EXPLORE") |
| 5 | Read the Synthesis | Read the synthesis text connecting theory and practice | "Synthesis" header, Markdown text |
| 6 | Review Theoretical Context | Examine the Theory Card (principles, frameworks) | Card title, theoretical icons |
| 7 | Review Practical Application | Examine the Application Card (scenario, media) | Card title, UI mockups, models |

## Task T3: Interpreting Scaffolding & Validation Feedback

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T3 |
| **Task Name** | Interpreting Scaffolding & Validation Feedback |
| **Scenario** | "Continuing from T2, the student sees the Scaffolding block generated by the Tutor Agent, and the Validation/Critique block from the Evaluator (evaluating against Instructional Design Principles). The student must interpret this feedback and decide what to do next." |
| **Precondition** | The AI response from T2 is fully rendered on screen, including the Scaffolding and Validation blocks. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Understands the pedagogical intent of the Tutor's Socratic question, (2) Interprets the Pass/Fail grades and remarks in the Evaluator's Validation badge, and (3) Identifies a clear next action to take. |
| **Failure Definition** | Ignores the scaffolding question, cannot understand the Evaluator's validation metrics, or experiences "dead-end" confusion about what to do next. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Locate Scaffolding Area | Scroll to find the Scaffolding Card | "Scaffolding" header, question mark icon |
| 2 | Comprehend Tutor's intent | Read the Socratic question and mentally formulate an answer | Question-formatted text, hints |
| 3 | Locate Validation Area | Scroll to find the Validation Badge | Validation label, Pass/Fail indicators |
| 4 | Review Evaluator's criteria | Check the scores/status for each Design Principle | Scores, color coding (Green/Red) |
| 5 | Interpret the critique | Read the text to understand "why" the score was given | Explanatory text, actionable suggestions |
| 6 | Determine next action | Decide whether to (a) refine prompt, (b) return to content, or (c) ask a new question | UI navigation links, text input box |

## Task T4: Operating Simulations & Verifying Learning

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T4 |
| **Task Name** | Operating Interactive Scenarios & Verifying Learning |
| **Scenario** | "The student notices an interactive scenario block generated by the Learning Designer Agent. They must manipulate the scenario variables to verify the constructivist principles visually, and successfully link this intuition back to the core concept." |
| **Precondition** | The Scenario block is visible within the AI response. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Successfully loads and interacts with the scenario, (2) Correctly associates the visual changes with the underlying teaching principles, and (3) Connects the experience back to the textbook content. |
| **Failure Definition** | Does not know how to interact with the scenario, misinterprets the pedagogical feedback, or fails to see how it relates to the learning objective. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Locate Scenario Area | Scroll to find the Scenario Frame | "Interactive Scenario" header, iframe/canvas |
| 2 | Understand scenario purpose | Read the Description text | Description label |
| 3 | Manipulate the scenario | Interact with choices, sliders, or elements | UI controls within the scenario |
| 4 | Observe visual feedback | Watch changes in learner motivation, outcome metrics, etc. | Changing graphs, mood indicators, results |
| 5 | Review Concepts Shown | Read the list of design concepts tied to the scenario | "Concepts" tag/label list |
| 6 | Link back to content | Connect the result mentally to Section 1.1's Constructivism | Navigation buttons (e.g., "Return to Content") |

## Appendix: Optional Task

### Task T5 (Optional): Search and Explore (CWW Perspective)
