# ALGET CW Task Definitions

## 4 Core Tasks — Tailored for ALGET Intelligent Textbook

---

## Task Design Principles

> In CW, **"Task selection determines the quality of the evaluation."** Each task must have clear starting preconditions and success criteria (Wharton et al., 1994).

The core learning flow of ALGET is decomposed into 4 tasks:

1. Entry and Content Navigation
2. AI-based Inquiry and Result Interpretation
3. Interpreting and Applying Scaffolding/Feedback
4. Operating Simulations and Verifying Learning

## Task T1: First Session & Content Navigation

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T1 |
| **Task Name** | First Session & Dynamics Navigation |
| **Scenario** | "A 2nd-year Mechanical Engineering student needs to study 'Rigid Body Kinematics' for their Dynamics module. They log into ALGET for the first time and must navigate to Chapter 1, Section 1.2 to understand base mechanics linked to physical motion." |
| **Precondition** | User is on the ALGET Dashboard. No prior experience with the system. |
| **Success Criterion** | The content for Section 1.2 is displayed on the screen, and the 'Learning Objectives' are clearly visible. |
| **Failure Definition** | Fails to reach Chapter 1, Section 1.2 within 3 minutes, or enters the wrong module. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **0** | **(First Impression)** | *Observe the screen for 3 seconds* | Overall layout, initial branding |
| 1 | Understand the system's purpose | Read the introduction/welcome area on the Dashboard | Header, Welcome message |
| 2 | Locate the 'Dynamics' course | Click "Dynamics" from the course menu/cards | Course labels, icons |
| 3 | Select Chapter 1 | Click "Ch1: Foundational Kinematics" | Chapter number, title, summary |
| 4 | Select Section 1.2 | Click "1.2 Rigid Body Mechanics in Motion" | Section number, title, est. time |

## Task T2: Bio-Design Lab Inquiry & AI Interpretation

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T2 |
| **Task Name** | Dynamics Lab Inquiry & AI Interpretation |
| **Scenario** | "While learning Dynamics, the student wants to apply the physics to a real-world scenario. They go to the Generative Lab and submit a query. They must interpret the AI's synthesized physics response." <br><br> **Baseline Prompt for CW:** "I am trying to calculate the torque required for the knee joint of my walking robot model. Can you give me an example of how this works in a cheetah's hind leg?" |
| **Precondition** | The user is actively reading Section 1.2. The Generative Lab is accessible. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Successfully submits the question, (2) Distinguishes between the biological context and the mechanical formulas, and (3) Understands the physics connection presented in the Synthesis area. |
| **Failure Definition** | Cannot find how to input the question, fails to grasp the distinction between biology and engineering formulas, or ignores the Synthesis entirely. |

*Note: The exact prompt is pre-defined to ensure comparability across all experts. If you feel a novice would struggle to formulate this question, record that as an Issue.*

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Navigate to Bio-Design Lab | Click "Bio-Design Lab" in the menu/UI | Menu item, Lab icon |
| 2 | Input the question | Type the prompt and click "Generate" | Input placeholder, Generate button |
| 3 | Wait for AI generation | Observe loading state | Spinner, "Thinking..." text |
| 4 | Check Intent classification | Read the "Detected Intent" badge | Intent Badge (e.g., "EXPLORE") |
| 5 | Read the Synthesis | Read the synthesis text connecting theory and practice | "Synthesis" header, Markdown text |
| 6 | Review Biological Context | Examine the Biology Card (anatomy, physical principles) | Card title, biological icons |
| 7 | Review Engineering Application | Examine the Engineering Card (component, schematics) | Card title, CAD mockups, blueprints |

## Task T3: Interpreting Scaffolding & Validation Feedback

### Task Definition

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Task ID** | T3 |
| **Task Name** | Interpreting Scaffolding in Bio-Inspired Design |
| **Scenario** | "The student transitions to the advanced **Bio-Inspired Design** module. They propose a silent drone propeller based on owl wing serrations. The student sees the Scaffolding block generated by the Tutor Agent, and the Validation block from the Evaluator (critiquing the trade-off between aeroacoustics and aerodynamic drag). The student must interpret this and decide what to do next." |
| **Precondition** | The AI response regarding the advanced Bio-Inspired prompt is fully rendered on screen. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Understands the Tutor's Socratic question about noise-drag trade-offs, (2) Interprets the Pass/Fail grades in the Evaluator's Validation badge, and (3) Identifies a clear next action to take. |
| **Failure Definition** | Ignores the scaffolding question about trade-offs, cannot understand the Evaluator's validation metrics, or experiences "dead-end" confusion. |

### Expected Step Decomposition

| Step | Learner Sub-goal | Correct UI Action | UI Cues Expected |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Locate Scaffolding Area | Scroll to find the Scaffolding Card | "Scaffolding" header, question mark icon |
| 2 | Comprehend Tutor's intent | Read the Socratic question and mentally formulate an answer | Question-formatted text, hints |
| 3 | Locate Validation Area | Scroll to find the Validation Badge | Validation label, Pass/Fail indicators |
| 4 | Review Evaluator's criteria | Check the scores/status for each Engineering Principle | Scores, color coding (Green/Red) |
| 5 | Interpret the critique | Read the text to understand "why" the score was given | Explanatory text, actionable suggestions |
| 6 | Determine next action | Decide whether to (a) refine prompt, (b) return to content, or (c) ask a new question | UI navigation links, text input box |

## Task T4: Operating Simulations & Verifying Learning

They must manipulate the wing serration variables to observe the change in micro-turbulence and noise, verifying the bio-inspired principles visually." <br><br> **Expected UI Concept:** A dual-panel interface. Left panel containing sliders for 'Serration Depth' and 'Angle of Attack'. Right panel showing CFD visualization metrics. |
| **Precondition** | The interactive CFD Scenario block is visible within the AI response. |
| **Success Criterion** | (1) Successfully loads and interacts with the parameter sliders, (2) Correctly associates the visual changes in the simulation with the underlying teaching principles, and (3) Connects the experience back to the textbook content. |
